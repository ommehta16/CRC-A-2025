# PHS-CRC-A-2025

all things for CRC Esoteric Engineering in 2025

## TODO

- `movement.py -> rotate(by:int)`
- `movement.py -> move_tiles()`
- `movement.py -> eject()`
- OCR

## RUNNING

- `python3 main.py`
- preferabbly, you run this as an always-on process on an rpi
- you NEED to have the motors connected for this to work (duh)

## CAMERA

### OCR

### Color Recognition

## Movement

## DEPENDENCIES

We only have a few dependencies, and most of them should already be installed.
What you *do* need to install is:

- opencv: `pip install opencv-python`
- picamzero: `pip install picamzero`
- easyocr: `pip install easyocr`

The rest should be pre-installed with python. If they aren't, you need `multiprocessing`, `time`, `numpy`, [whatever you used for color recognition idek @PhantomFrenzy151 ??]
